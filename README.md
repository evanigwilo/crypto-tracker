## Why I built this
I built this app as the cryptocurrency markets are currently all over the place and it's really a decentralized blockchain technology as it allows for transactions to be made reliably, but without third parties.<br/>
The goal was to address the needs of cryptocurrency investors and traders by providing real-time information about cryptocurrency prices, supply fluctuations and market capitalization.
